# Further analysis

Now you've worked through an example of the open-gira workflow, 
and you have an understanding of the relevant file formats, how the process works, 
and how to inspect things as you go along, you're ready to use open-gira
for your own work.
Find an OSM datafile to work with, slice it up, and intersect some hazard data.
The resulting .geopandas data can be manipulated to answer particular questions, 
or further combined with different spatial information or other open-gira outputs.
