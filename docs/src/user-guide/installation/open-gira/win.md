# Windows installation

Native installation on Windows is extremely difficult because of the difficulty
building the tools that open-gira relies on (binaries are not available for
Windows).
To avoid this issue, we recommend Windows users install via Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL).
To install WSL, follow the [install instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Once WSL is installed, open-gira can be installed inside the Linux subsystem by following the
[Linux install instructions](linux.md).
