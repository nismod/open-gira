# Trim hazard rasters

The hazard raster files that were downloaded [earlier](download-hazard.md)
contain data for the entire world.
These are then trimmed so they match the OpenStreetMap datasets we downloaded.
The trimmed files for the first hazard and infrastructure combination are saved to 
`./results/input/hazard-aqueduct-coast/tanzania-latest/` with their filenames.
The filenames are preserved because they give information about where the hazard
data comes from.
