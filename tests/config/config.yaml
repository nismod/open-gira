# this is a config file used when testing open-gira with: `pytest tests`
# is it based on the primary config file, with changes to make jobs run faster
# e.g. fewer datasets, smaller extracts

# ideally it would the primary config file where there are no need for changes,
# but to my knowledge YAML files are not composable, modular, referenceable etc.
