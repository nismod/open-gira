Lints for snakefile /mnt/f/OxRSE/open-gira/workflow/rules/convert_to_geoparquet.smk:
    * Mixed rules and functions in same snakefile.:
      Small one-liner functions used only once should be defined as lambda
      expressions. Other functions should be collected in a common module, e.g.
      'rules/common.smk'. This makes the workflow steps more readable.
